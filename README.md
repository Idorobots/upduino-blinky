# Upduino Blinky

This repository contains two Blinky projects for the Upduino v2 board - na√Øve one that drives the LEDs directly and one that uses a proper PWM driver.

To build and test it run:

```
apio verify
apio build
apio upload
```

More info and some description is available on [my blog](https://blog.idorobots.org/entries/upduino-fpga-tutorial.html).
